# Hexagonal Architecture 


The hexagonal architecture, or ports and adapters architecture, is an architectural pattern used in 
software design. It aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected 
to their software environment by means of ports and adapters. This makes components exchangeable at any 
level and facilitates test automation.
